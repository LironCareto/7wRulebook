# 7 Wonders - The unified rulebook

This rulebook is intended to be a single source for looking up rules for 7 Wonders, unifying the various sources of information in a single place. It's also intended to be as detailed and precise as possible.

[Click here to check out the rulebook itself!](http://lironcareto.github.io/7wRulebook/rulebook.html)

Please [submit corrections or suggestions to me](https://github.com/lironcareto/7wRulebook/issues) if something is wrong or unclear. 

This project is a derivate of the wonderful work of [@jbiatek](https://github.com/jbiatek) in [http://jbiatek.github.io/BSGRulebook](http://jbiatek.github.io/BSGRulebook). All technical praise goes to him. I just adapted the text for 7 Wonders.
